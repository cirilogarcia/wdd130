    <p>Hello everyone I would like to tell you about myself, I was born and raised in Kansas City, Kansas. I am currently pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. At this current moment I am a construction foreman for a concrete company. I know programming seems like a huge career change but programming was what I originally wanted to do after high school.</p> 
    <p>I am married to my wife Blanca we currently don't have any children although I would count our puppy Leo as a child. He is 10 months old and causes us so much joy and headaches at the same time. Crazy story about how I met my wife is she is actually my Mission Presidents daughter, I served in the Honduras Comayaguela Mission I can honestly say serving a mission was the best decision of my life!</p>
    <p>I hope to learn from all of you this semester, best of luck!</p>
